how to create a new branch and merge it later

Step 1: Create a New Branch

git branch my-new-branch

Step 2: Switch to the New Branch (if not done already)

git switch my-new-branch

Step 3: Make Changes and Commit
Modify your files, then stage and commit them:

git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"

Step 4: Switch Back to the Main Branch

git switch main

Step 5: Merge the Branch into Main

git merge my-new-branch

Step 6: (Optional) Delete the Merged Branch

git branch -d my-new-branch

If the branch is not fully merged and you still want to delete it, use:

git branch -D my-new-branch

Bonus: Push the Branch to a Remote Repository
To share your branch with others, push it to a remote repository:

git push origin my-new-branch


       OR

Step 1: Create and Switch to a New Branch
git checkout -b my-branch

Step 2: Make Changes and Commit
git add .
git commit -m "My changes"

Step 3: Switch Back to Main Branch
git checkout main

Step 4: Merge the Branch into Main
git merge my-branch

Step 5: Delete the Branch (Optional)
git branch -d my-branch
